# AtliQ Hardware Computer - Codebasics Challenge 4
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. As a junior data analyst my task was to give insights of data for fiscal year 2020 and 2021

### I have completed three tasks:
1. There were 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2. I wrote SQL queries to answer these requests. 
3. The target audience of this dashboard was top-level management - hence I created a presentation to show the insights.
